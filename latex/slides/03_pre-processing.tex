    \frametitle{The analytic signal}
    \small
    The acceleration signal is high-pass filtered to remove unwanted machine noise.  The design of these filters are outside the scope of this presentation.  The resulting acceleration signal $x(t)$ is then used to generate an analytic signal, $z(t)$.  It is defined as 
    \begin{equation}
        z(t) = x(t) + j y(t) = a(t) e^{j\theta}
    \end{equation}
    
    where $j^2=-1$ and $y(t)$ is the Hilbert transform of $x(t)$ can conceptually be considered as the convolution $x(t) * \frac{1}{t}$. and where the amplitude is
    
    \begin{equation}
        a(t) = \sqrt{x^2(t)+y^2(t)}
    \end{equation}
    
    and the phase (not to be confused with phase shift is
    
    \begin{equation}
        \theta(t) = \arctan\Big(\frac{y}{x}\Big)
    \end{equation}
