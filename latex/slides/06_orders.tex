    In the envelope spectrum, $E(\omega)$, the frequencies will scale with the shaft speed, $f_r$. The order spectrum is an envelope spectrum where the frequencies are normalized with the rotation speed, denoted as order, so that
    
    \begin{equation}
        [\text{order}] = \Big[\frac{f}{f_r}\Big]
    \end{equation}
    
    where in the order domain one get that $1 = f_r$.
